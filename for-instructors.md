## FAQ

**I am an first-time lead instructor and wondering where to start with getting a workshop setup. Do you have a good set of tips?**

We have developed a set of tips and a [workshop checklist](/organizing-workshops/) that we think is useful for new instructors. If you have any suggestions we would love to include them! 

**How can workshop attendees can continue their learning at the University of Chicago after the workshop is done?** 

Here are a few resources that we know of:

- **[Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/workshops-and-training)**: offers research and training throughout the year on various computing topics
- **UChicago-KISS**: social science graduate student organization to support with learning programming and research methods. Please contact Colin Quirk if you are interested in participating in the group.
- **R Bar at Harris School of Public Policy**: student-run support for R-related needs, mostly for Harris students
- **[R-Ladies Chicago](https://rladieschicago.org/) / [Py-Ladies Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-PyLadies/)**: Monthly Meetups for women and gender minorities in the area
